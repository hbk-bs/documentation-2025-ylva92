# Project Briefing: Documentation 2025

This is it. Your final task for this seminar: create a web-based documentation of your work from the summer semester 2025.

## Objective

Reflect on your projects, what you've learned, and how your thinking has evolved. Don't forget to include work from the whole year--yes, that includes the Debate Club and the excursion.

## Your Mission

### 1. Get Organized

- Collect all assets: code, sketches, screenshots, images, videos, links.
- Think about how you want to tell the story of your semester.
- Draft in Markdown or HTML--whatever gets you there faster.

### 2. Design & Build

- Create a template or layout that works across your projects.
- Use placeholder content to experiment with structure and style.
- Host your work using GitHub Pages (this time, you set it up yourself).

### 3. Make It Real

- Replace dummies with real content: working examples, images, reflections.
- Make it responsive! I will read it on a phone. So mobile first.
- Check that all links and embedded content work as intended.

## What to Include

- For each project:
	- A short written reflection: What was the idea? What worked? What didn't?
	- At least one visual (screenshot, photo, sketch, video still).
	- Links to the GitHub repository and the live demo
- General reflection (min. 300 words):
	- What did you learn this year?
	- What tools, techniques, and concepts stuck with you?
	- What surprised you?

## Tips

- Use browser dev tools to test for mobile.
- Avoid lorem ipsum or broken links.
- If AI helped, make sure you understand the output.
- This is your archive, not a blog. Keep it clear and purposeful.

## Deliverables

- A live GitHub Pages site with your documentation
- A `README.md` explaining the repo structure and content
- A `LICENSE` file for your content (choose one you understand)
